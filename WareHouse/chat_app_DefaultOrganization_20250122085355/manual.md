# Chat with OpenAI App User Manual

This document provides a comprehensive guide on how to use the Chat with OpenAI application, which allows you to interact with OpenAI's language models through a user-friendly interface built with Streamlit.

## Introduction

The Chat with OpenAI app is a simple yet powerful tool that enables users to have conversational interactions with OpenAI's language models. Built using Python, Streamlit, and the OpenAI API, this app provides a seamless way to generate text responses, brainstorm ideas, and explore the capabilities of large language models.

## Main Functions

1.  **Chat Interface**: A clean and intuitive chat interface allows users to type in their prompts and receive responses in real-time.
2.  **Real-time Responses**: Leverages the OpenAI API to provide instant responses based on user input.
3.  **Conversation History**: Keeps track of the conversation history, allowing users to scroll back and refer to previous prompts and responses.
4.  **Error Handling**: Incorporates error handling to manage issues, such as API connection problems, providing useful feedback to the users.
5.  **User-Friendly**: The app is designed with ease of use in mind, requiring minimal technical knowledge to operate.

## Installation

### 1. Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following:

*   **Python 3.7 or higher:** The app is built in Python, so it needs to be installed on your system. You can download the latest version [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
*   **A Code Editor (Optional):** While not necessary to run the app, a code editor such as VSCode, Sublime Text, or Atom can be useful for viewing and modifying the code.
*   **OpenAI API Key:** You will need an OpenAI API key to communicate with the OpenAI models. Get your API Key [here](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)

### 2. Setting up the Environment

1.  **Clone the Repository (if available):**
    If you have a repository for the project, start by cloning it onto your local machine using git.
    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd <repository_folder>
    ```
   If you have the python file and `requirements.txt` directly, you can skip the clone.

2.  **Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended):**
    It is highly recommended that you create a virtual environment to manage the app's dependencies. This will ensure that the required packages don't conflict with other Python projects on your machine.
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    ```
    Then activate the virtual environment by using the relevant command for your OS:
        * Windows `venv\Scripts\activate`
        * Linux or Mac `source venv/bin/activate`

3.  **Install Dependencies:**
    Use `pip` to install the required packages from `requirements.txt`.
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Create an `.env` file:**
    In the same directory where `main.py` is, create a new file named `.env` and add your OpenAI API key in the following format.
    ```
    OPENAI_API_KEY=YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY_HERE
    ```
    Replace `YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY_HERE` with your actual OpenAI API key.

## How to Use

1.  **Run the Application:**
    Open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the project directory, and run the Streamlit app using the following command:
    ```bash
    streamlit run main.py
    ```
    This will launch the application in your default web browser.

2.  **Interact with the Chat Interface:**
    Once the app is running, you'll see a chat interface. In the message input box at the bottom of the page, type your message and press Enter or click the send arrow to submit it.

3.  **Receive Responses:**
    The app will process your prompt and display the response from the OpenAI model in the chat window.

4.  **Conversation History:**
    You can continue the conversation by submitting new prompts. The full chat history is available, allowing you to scroll up to view previous interactions.

5.  **Clear the Chat:**
    If you wish to start a new conversation, simply refresh the page. This will clear the current chat history and you can start a fresh conversation.

## Troubleshooting

*   **API Key Error:** If you get an error saying "The OPENAI\_API\_KEY is missing from .env file or environment variables", ensure that you have set your API key in the `.env` file correctly.
*   **API Call Error:** If you get error regarding API call, ensure that you have the correct internet connection. If the connection is correct, please check your API keys if it is valid.
*   **Dependency Issues:** If you encounter errors related to missing packages, make sure you have installed all the required packages listed in the `requirements.txt` file by using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
*   **Streamlit Not Working:** If Streamlit does not load in your browser, please check if you have the correct python environment activated.
*   **For all other errors**: Please ensure the code `main.py` is the same as the provided code.

## Conclusion

The Chat with OpenAI app provides an easy and efficient way to interact with OpenAI's powerful language models. With a simple setup and intuitive interface, you can quickly explore the vast capabilities of AI-driven conversational applications. Enjoy your interaction!
