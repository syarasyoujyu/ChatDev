Okay, I will create a `manual.md` file to guide users on how to install and use the drawing app with forecasting capabilities.

# Drawing App with Forecasting - User Manual

This document provides a detailed guide on how to install and use the drawing application with forecasting, which allows you to draw and predict the continuation of your drawing.

## 1. Introduction

This application allows users to draw on a canvas and then uses a prediction model to forecast the likely continuation of the drawing. The prediction is displayed as a dashed red line.

### 1.1. Main Features

*   **Drawing Canvas:** A white canvas where you can draw using your mouse.
*   **Prediction:** The application predicts the continuation of your drawing.
*   **Clear Prediction:** Each new stroke generates a new prediction, clearing the previous one.
*   **Simple UI:** Easy-to-use interface with a predict button.

## 2. Installation

### 2.1. Prerequisites

*   Python 3.6 or higher is required.

### 2.2. Installing Dependencies

1.  Create a virtual environment (recommended):

    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Linux/macOS
    venv\Scripts\activate.bat # On Windows
    ```

2.  Install the required packages using pip:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

    The `requirements.txt` file should contain:

    ```
    numpy
    ```

## 3. Usage

### 3.1. Running the Application

1.  Navigate to the directory containing the `main.py`, `drawing_canvas.py`, and `prediction_model.py` files.

2.  Run the application:

    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

### 3.2. Drawing and Forecasting

1.  **Drawing:** Click and drag your mouse on the white canvas to draw. The drawing will appear as a black line.

2.  **Predicting:** Once you have drawn something, click the "Predict" button. A red dashed line will appear, showing the predicted continuation of your drawing.

3.  **New Drawing:** Start a new drawing by simply starting a new stroke (clicking and dragging again). The previous prediction will be cleared, and the application will be ready to predict the new drawing.

### 3.3. Troubleshooting

*   **No Prediction:** If the prediction does not appear, ensure you have drawn at least three points. The model requires a few points to make a prediction.
*   **Errors during installation:** Double-check that you have correctly installed all the dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`.
*   **Application Freezes/Crashes:**  This is usually due to numpy issues. Verify numpy is installed correctly and is the correct version.
*   **Prediction not accurate:** The prediction model is very simple (quadratic polynomial).  Don't expect accurate results with complex shapes.  The accuracy depends entirely on how well the last few points fit a quadratic curve.

## 4. Code Structure

The application consists of three main files:

*   `main.py`: Contains the main application logic, including the `MainWindow` class, which sets up the GUI and handles user interactions.
*   `drawing_canvas.py`: Defines the `DrawingCanvas` class, a custom Tkinter Canvas widget for drawing.
*   `prediction_model.py`: Defines the `predict_drawing` function, which implements the prediction model.

## 5. Prediction Model Details

The prediction model uses a simple polynomial (quadratic) fit to predict the next points in the drawing. The last few points of the drawing are used to fit a quadratic curve, and then this curve is extrapolated to generate the predicted points. Normalization is performed on the coordinate data to improve prediction accuracy.

## 6. Future Improvements

*   Implement different prediction models (e.g., machine learning models).
*   Add options to customize the drawing color and line width.
*   Add functionality to save and load drawings.
*   Improve the user interface with more advanced features.
